Tree Depth Data

For our regression experiments we used a large corpus with sentences with unambiguous but varied syntactic structures, generated by a script that follows a predefined context-free grammar.
The output of this script is a four column file containing ('1M_sentences.txt'):
- The generated sentence.
- The syntactic parse tree of the sentence, according to the grammar that was used to generate it.
- The number of open nodes (syntactic tree-depth), following Nelson et. al, 2017.
- The number of adjacent open and closing brackets before each word
The columns of the file are separated with the character |.
